# AircraftSimulation_RL
The objective of this project is to develop aircraft simulations in game development using reinforcement learning. The expected outcome is to demonstrate the efficiency of reinforcement learning in a real-life scenario where the aircraft can fly by evaluating the flight path on its own.
